"""
 You should define the Point class. Each object instantiated from Point represents a point in the two-dimensional area.
 You should define the ProfessionalPoint class. ProfessionalPoint should extend Point.
 The ProfessionalPoint should add the length() method. The length() method returns
 the distance from the point to the (0,0) point. Check your classes by calculating the distance of (3,4) from (0,0).
